# What is the OSI model?
- Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
- The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
- The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology

# How is the OSI model organized?
1- Alphabetically
2- From the lowest to the highest level
3- Randomly
